## Distinctiveness and Complexity:
    This project is very different to what we have been working on with 
    projects like commerce and network. This project uses the django
    restframework along with react. Using react as the frontend came 
    with several new changes to what we were used to like components 
    which were not in regular javascript. I had to send request's to my 
    backend (restframework) to get the user data through to the 
    frontend. The backend required serializing, api classes and
    auhtentication using a JWT (JSON Web Token) which has an acces 
    token and a refresh token for extra security. Learning two new 
    frameworks did put the complexity of this project higher than 
    expected knwoing all the different syntax.
